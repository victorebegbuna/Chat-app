Am so glad to have completed this project
This project gave me some challenges and it took me lots of time to finish up, i had to write over 200 lines of code in my CSS, but in all, it came out fine.
This is is giving me the confident to go back to the previous ones that really didnt look close and work more on them.
I learnt quite alot of new things while working on this particular project and I hope to learn more as I work further on more projects.

Very very soon, I hope to add Java to it, but for now, let me perfect my HTML and CSS.

Thanks for reading!.
